About Me:
Hello! I'm Clara, a native of Seville, Spain, but my heart belongs to the world. I'm an environmental scientist by profession, but a wanderer at heart. The beauty of our planet never ceases to amaze me, and I've been fortunate enough to explore some of its most breathtaking corners.

Travel Preferences:

Accommodation: Boutique hotels and eco-lodges. I have a penchant for places that blend in with nature, offering a genuine experience without compromising on comfort.

Transportation: Trains and road trips! There's something magical about watching the landscapes change right before your eyes. I often opt for car rentals or join group travels that align with my interests.

Activities: Hiking, diving, and cultural immersions. Mountains, oceans, and local markets are my favorite playgrounds. In recent years, I've taken up photography and often spend hours capturing the nuances of a new place.

Most Memorable Trips:

Hiking in Patagonia: The raw beauty of Torres del Paine National Park left me in awe. The challenge of the trek combined with the surreal landscapes made it a journey I'll never forget.

Diving in the Maldives: Encountering manta rays, vibrant corals, and bioluminescent plankton felt like stepping into another world. The underwater tranquility is a stark contrast to the bustling cities I'm used to.

Attending the Lantern Festival in Chiang Mai: It's a profound experience to watch thousands of lanterns light up the night sky, each carrying a unique wish or prayer. The sense of community and shared hope was palpable.

Food Preferences:
Local cuisines are a big part of my travels. From sampling spicy curries in Thailand to savoring fresh seafood in Mediterranean towns, I believe food tells a story of its own. I'm pescatarian, so coastal cities are often my favorite culinary destinations.

Travel Mantra:
Travel with intent, respect, and an open heart. I always try to leave a place better than I found it, whether it's by participating in a local clean-up project, supporting sustainable businesses, or simply spreading kindness.
